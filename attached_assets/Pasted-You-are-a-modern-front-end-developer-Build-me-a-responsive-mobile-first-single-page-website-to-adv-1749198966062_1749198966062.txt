You are a modern front-end developer. Build me a responsive, mobile-first single-page website to advertise my IT & English tutoring business. Follow these requirements exactly:

1. **Overall Layout & Navigation**
   - Mobile-first design that scales up gracefully to desktop.
   - Top navigation bar with:
     - A placeholder logo (“R”) on the top-left.
     - Menu items on the right (e.g. “Home,” “About,” “Lessons,” “Testimonials,” “Contact”).
   - Footer with copyright and social links.

2. **Hero Section**
   - Full-width “split slider” hero layout:
     - A draggable vertical slider starting at center.
     - Left panel: English lessons theme (e.g. subtle UK/US flags, serif typography).
     - Right panel: Programming lessons theme (Linux-terminal style: monospace font, dark background, green text).
   - Background animation behind the programming panel using a Conway’s Game of Life glider pattern (CSS Canvas or WebGL).
   - Placeholder stock image behind both panels (centered).
   - Smooth CSS transition/animation when sliding.
   - Prominent “Get Started” call-to-action button centered below slider; clicking scrolls to the contact form.

3. **Split Interaction Behavior**
   - When slider handle is dragged left, reveal more of the programming (right) panel; when dragged right, reveal more of the English (left) panel.
   - Ensure keyboard accessibility for the slider (arrow keys).
   - Default slider position: exactly centered.

4. **Content Sections (below hero)**
   1. **Contact Form**  
      - Simple fields: Name, Email, Lesson Type (dropdown: English / Programming), Message, Submit button.
   2. **Testimonials**  
      - Carousel or grid of at least 3 testimonial cards with student photos, names, and quotes.
   3. **Social Media Links**  
      - Icons linking to Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram (use placeholder `#`).

5. **Styling & Interaction**
   - Use modern CSS (Flexbox or Grid) and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks required).
   - Mobile navigation should collapse into a hamburger menu.
   - Smooth scroll effect for in-page links.
   - Use placeholder assets for logo and images; mark them clearly in code as TODO.
